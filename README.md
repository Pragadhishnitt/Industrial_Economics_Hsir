In this research project we tend to find the best model as of now for stock prediction on tweets based on sentiment analysis. 

The dataset that we have used is stocknet and we took this over astock as this overperformed astock in many aspects.

Training data size is 38000 sentences. The data was raw in JSON format. So we had to preprocess it and give sentiment scores based on vader sentiment intensity analyzer.

We primarily ran our design on 7 different models:

1. ULMfit
2. BART
3. BERT
4. RoBERTa
5. XLnet
6. ELECTRA
7. SVMs

The accuracy of all models has been calculated and documented.
